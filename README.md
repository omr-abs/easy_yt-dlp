# easy_yt-dlp

## 🎯 About This Project

I’m a lazy person who just stumbled upon yt-dlp — and I didn’t want to type commands every time I wanted to download a song, a playlist, or some random YouTube video.  

So, I made this interactive batch tool to make my life easier.

This script is designed for people like me who want to:

- ✅ Paste a YouTube link or playlist and download instantly — no commands needed  
- ✅ Automatically get the **best available video+audio** (e.g. 1080p60, 4K), or manually pick formats  
- ✅ Download full playlists or multiple videos at once  
- ✅ Convert audio to MP3 with one click  
- ✅ Automatically **merge video and audio** using `ffmpeg` when needed  
- ✅ Use **cookie-based login** to access private or age-restricted videos  
- ✅ Choose the **download folder**, with history logging to keep track  
- ✅ Stay **fully portable** — uses a local `ffmpeg_bin` folder with no system install required  

All this — without needing to remember or type any yt-dlp commands. It's simple, fast, and portable — and you don’t need to install anything system-wide.

Enjoy!
